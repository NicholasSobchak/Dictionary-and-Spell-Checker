# Dictionary-Spell-Checker
The Spell Checker is a C++ application that uses a Trie (prefix) tree to identify and search a large collection of English words i.e. 20,000 words. The program loads a dictionary file that is identified by a Trie tree, allowing the user to quickly check whether a given word is spelled correctly. If a word is not found, the program can suggest corrections based on similar words stored within the tree.

This project will demonstrate efficient text lookup using Trie search time, O(L). Making it a practical data-structure-driven tool.

The goal of this project is to apply a Trie trees to a real-world context word lookup and spell checking
This includes experience with:
  * Trie implementation
  * Recursion and node manipulation
  * File reading and dictionary parsing
  * Designing search and suggestion algorithms
  * Organizing a dictionary efficiently in memory


Features:
  * Load Dictionary for Trie
  * Word lookup (Spell Check)
  * Suggested Word Corrections
  * Display Dictionary (Alphabetical Order)

# Application
This project imitates how a search engine, phone keyboard, text editor, and word processors autocomplete words. 
By using a Trie, the application performs fast prefix lookups, making it ideal for spell checking, autocompletion, and dictionary systems.

# Dictionary-Spell-Checker
The Dictionary and Spell Checker is a C++ application that uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store and search a large collection of English words i.e. 20,000 words. The program loads a dictionary file into a BST, allowing the user to quickly check whether a given word is spelled correctly. If a word is not found, the program can suggest corrections based on similar words stored within the tree.

This project will demonstrate efficient text lookup using BST search time (average O(log n)), making it a practical data-structure-driven tool.

The goal of this project is to apply binary search trees to a real-world context word lookup and spell checking
This includes experience with:
  - BST implementation
  - Recursion and node manipulation
  - File reading and dictionary parsing
  - Designing search and suggestion algorithms
  - Organizing a dictionary efficiently in memory


Features:
  1. Load Dictionary into BST
  2. Word lookup (Spell Check)
  3. Suggested Word Corrections
  4. Display Dictionary (Alphabetical Order)
